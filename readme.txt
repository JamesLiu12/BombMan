1.  Game Introduction:

A game contains one or two players and one or two robot players. Each player has infinite bomb to plant but have a 1.5s CD. The bomb will block the way and each bomb will release cross shape laser after 1.5s bomb have been planted. The players has 3 initial HP and minus 1 when being hit. After being shotten by laser, the player will get 2s dodging all lasers. 
If HP downs below 0, the player will be removed from the map. The game will last 3 min to determine winner with highest score. If there is only last player, game will end immediately, and that player become survivor. However, if the game last for full 3 min, all players last will be survivor. Because of system difference, we strongly recommend you play on windows system, the unroot Linux(ed) version only support 1 player playing with bots. Also, movement in unroot Linux will have delay.

6.  Rules for getting score:
Removing obstacles can produce 1 point, weather what level the obstacle is. Use laser to shot other players can get 2 points. 
But if player’s bomb hurt itself, the score will minus 3 points. Therefore this game mechanic encourages players to kill others, but it also offers another choice for players to avoid battling
